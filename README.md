# Gamehub - Android version

This app is made for those who like to play (board)games but need others to play with them. As a user you will be able to create a game party to play with others or join an already existing party. In doing so, you will meet new people and have lots of fun!

## Installation

```

### Test credentials

Email: test@hotmail.com

### Slow load on launch
This is normal, since I'm using the free hosting platform of [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). This means that my backend is running online, but it's not running permanently. When you send your first request, the backend will start up but by that time, a `SocketTimeoutException` will be thrown. This is caught and resent but this means that the inital startup will be rather slow. After that inital request, my backend will have started up and will work smoothly.
